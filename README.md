# Weather App

"You can clone the repository and run it on your local machine. The WeatherApp displays the current weather forecast. To search for a city, click the arrow button next to the city name. This will reveal an input field where you can enter the city name. Once entered, press Enter. In the desktop version, on the right side of the main section, there is a display of the current time and day(representing with caruosel), along with weather icons representing the weather conditions for each day. Below this information, you can find details about the current weather. Note that the charts are only visual representations."
